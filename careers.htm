could amplify our imagination, extend our intellect, and help us model information in ways never before seen. This is the type of tool we want to build together at Notion — one that gives you the software you can mold and shape like clay to solve your problems your way.</p><p class="jsx-34bb0f03d99ea10c">We’ve heard Notion described many ways. It can be as simple as a blank piece of paper, making writing feel light and delightful. It can be as complex as a relational database that stores huge amounts of data. We sometimes compare it to a set of Legos (if Legos were designed by The New York Times). But at its core, Notion is a toolbox of software building blocks that let you manage your life and work however you find most useful.</p><p class="jsx-34bb0f03d99ea10c">To make this possible, we’ve brought together a diverse team of individuals passionate about computing, history, art, alternative programming languages, music, skateboarding, and craft. Today, we’re growing faster than ever across offices in San Francisco, New York, Dublin, Hyderabad and Tokyo 🇺🇸 🇮🇪 🇮🇳 🇯🇵</p><p class="jsx-34bb0f03d99ea10c link"><a
